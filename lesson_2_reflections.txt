What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    it starts to track the file updates and commits
    
    
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
    
    
    working directory -> current directory where you are doing your editing
    staging area -> only after you add the file to the staging area, can you then use
                    git commit to commit the changes to the repository
    repository -> the place where all your previous commits are stored

check out a commit:  git checkout
get all history commit: git log
create repository: git init
add file to staging area: git add filename
commit changes of files in the staging area: git commit filename
get status of staging area: git status
see difference between two commits: git diff commit_old commit_new
compare working directory and staging area: git diff
compare staging area and last commits in repository: git diff --staged
