How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was
introduced?

1. provide a baseline for comparison
2. save the effort to spot diff
3. difference are the most likely reason for the bug 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient
programmer in the long term?

1. If there is anything wrong with the current version, one can always go back to the
previous version to restart the work
2. If one ever wants to change part of the code back to previous version, he cannot do
it without referring back to the history files

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pros:
1. have more direct control and knowledge of the difference between different versions
2. save based on personal preference
3. have more logical structure or naming convention of the version control structure

cons:
1. if one forgets to save, the progress might lost
2. when multi-people editing together and save different versions at the same time, it is
not easy to identify what changes were captured

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in
one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

1. Git is used more by coding project where multiple code files need to work together to
function
2. Google Doc is text file where one file does not impact the function of the other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
